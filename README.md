4. **Classroom Resource Management**  
   - Automates **electrical resource control** (e.g., lights and power outlets) using a dual-relay card.  

5. **Real-Time Notifications**  
   - Sends pre-class reminders and attendance summaries via the **WhatsApp API**.  

6. **Data Storage and Visualization**  
   - Attendance and engagement data are stored in an **SQLite database** and displayed on intuitive dashboards.  

7. **User-Specific Dashboards**  
   - Tailored dashboards for administrators, professors, and students for data-driven decision-making.
